# Project Documentation: Search Optimization Algorithms

## Introduction
This project implements and compares the performance of various search algorithms to determine their efficiency for different scenarios. The dataset used for testing is a list of usernames stored in a file (`usernames.txt`). Algorithms include:

1. **Linear Search**
2. **Binary Search**
3. **Hash Table Search**
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
5. **Bloom Filter**

Each algorithm was tested to analyze their execution time and applicability to specific types of data and queries.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Linear Search
#### How it works:
- Iterates through the dataset element by element.
- Compares each element with the target.
- Returns the index if found, otherwise returns `-1`.

#### Advantages:
- Simple to implement.
- Works on unsorted data.

#### Disadvantages:
- Slow for large datasets as its time complexity is **O(n)**.

---

### 2. Binary Search
#### How it works:
- Requires the dataset to be sorted.
- Repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
- Compares the middle element with the target.
- Returns the index if found, otherwise adjusts the interval.

#### Advantages:
- Efficient with time complexity of **O(log n)**.
- Ideal for sorted datasets.

#### Disadvantages:
- Cannot be used on unsorted data without preprocessing.

---

### 3. Hash Table Search
#### How it works:
- Uses a hash table to store the dataset as key-value pairs.
- Hashes the target to directly access its index.

#### Advantages:
- Extremely fast with average time complexity of **O(1)**.
- Suitable for large datasets.

#### Disadvantages:
- Requires additional memory for the hash table.
- Susceptible to hash collisions, though mitigated by proper hash functions.

---

### 4. Binary Search Tree (BST)
#### How it works:
- Organizes data hierarchically in a tree structure.
- Searches by traversing the tree based on comparisons with the root node.

#### Advantages:
- Efficient for dynamic datasets that frequently change.
- Average time complexity of **O(log n)** for balanced trees.

#### Disadvantages:
- Can become unbalanced, leading to worst-case time complexity of **O(n)**.
- Requires additional computation for balancing.

---

### 5. Bloom Filter
#### How it works:
- A probabilistic data structure using a bit array and multiple hash functions.
- Adds elements by setting specific bits in the array.
- Checks elements by verifying if corresponding bits are set.

#### Advantages:
- Very fast with time complexity of **O(1)**.
- Memory efficient.
- Excellent for membership tests (e.g., "Is this item in the dataset?").

#### Disadvantages:
- Can produce **false positives** (reports an element exists when it does not).
- Cannot remove elements once added.

## Why Bloom Filter is the Better Solution

### Problem Context:
- The dataset (`usernames.txt`) contains a large list of usernames.
- The task involves checking membership queries (e.g., "Is this username in the dataset?").

### Comparison:
1. **Efficiency:**
   - Bloom Filter has constant time complexity **O(1)**, making it significantly faster than linear or binary search for large datasets.

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Bloom Filters use minimal memory compared to hash tables, especially when the dataset size grows.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Ideal for applications with large-scale datasets where fast membership checks are critical (e.g., spam filters, cache systems).

4. **Limitations Managed:**
   - False positives are acceptable in many use cases, and the low error rate of the Bloom Filter used in this project (2 hash functions, size=5000) ensures reliable results.

## Results and Analysis
- All algorithms were tested using the dataset, and their execution times were measured.
- Bloom Filter consistently achieved execution times below **0.00005 seconds**, making it the most efficient algorithm for the given problem.
- Detailed results are stored in `algorithm_analysis.csv`, and the performance comparison is visualized in `algorithm_comparison.png`.

## Conclusion
Bloom Filter proved to be the most effective solution for membership queries in this project due to its speed, efficiency, and scalability. While other algorithms like hash tables and binary search also performed well, they require more memory or preprocessing. The results demonstrate that Bloom Filters are an excellent choice for scenarios where fast and memory-efficient membership testing is needed.
